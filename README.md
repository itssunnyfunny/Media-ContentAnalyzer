# AI-content-Analyzer

AI-content-Analyzer is a robust platform designed to analyze, process, and search content using advanced AI and NLP techniques. The system is built with a modern, scalable architecture leveraging microservices and real-time data processing.

## Architecture Overview

The platform is composed of several layers and technologies:

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Data Pipeline:** Kafka
- **Analytics:** Custom NLP (Node.js)
- **Search:** Elasticsearch
- **AI Engine:** Node.js / Python
- **Deployment:** Docker
- **Auth/Security:** OAuth2 / JWT

## Features

- Real-time content ingestion and processing
- Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) analytics
- Full-text and semantic search capabilities
- Scalable microservices architecture
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Containerized deployment for easy scaling and management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Python (for AI Engine, if using Python modules)
- Docker
- Kafka
- Elasticsearch

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-content-Analyzer.git
   cd AI-content-Analyzer
   ```
2. Install dependencies for each service (example for Node.js services):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   # Repeat for other services as needed
   ```
3. Set up environment variables for OAuth2/JWT and service connections.
4. Start services using Docker Compose or manually.

### Usage
- Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` (default Next.js port).
- Use the API endpoints for content ingestion and analytics.
- Search content via the integrated search interface.

## Security
- OAuth2 and JWT are used for secure authentication and authorization.
- Ensure environment variables and secrets are managed securely.
